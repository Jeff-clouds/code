How to Install a Chrome Extension from a Folder
Prepare the Extension Folder

Ensure you have the entire folder of the Chrome extension saved on your computer. This folder should include all the necessary files (e.g., manifest.json, icons, scripts, etc.).
If you're working with a downloaded extension or one you've developed, make sure there’s no missing file.
Open Google Chrome

Launch Google Chrome on your computer.
Go to the Extensions Page

In Chrome’s address bar, type chrome://extensions and press Enter.
Alternatively, click the three vertical dots in the top-right corner, select More tools, then Extensions.
Enable Developer Mode

On the Extensions page, enable Developer mode by toggling the switch located in the top-right corner. This allows you to load extensions manually.
Load the Unpacked Extension

Once Developer mode is enabled, you'll see a few options appear at the top of the page. Click the Load unpacked button.
Select the Folder Containing the Extension

A file dialog will appear. Navigate to the folder containing your extension’s files, and select it.
Make sure you select the root folder of the extension, which should contain the manifest.json file.
Confirm the Installation

Chrome will now add the extension to your browser. You should see a notification confirming that the extension was added, and its icon will appear in the toolbar (if the extension has one).
If any errors occur (e.g., missing files or incorrect permissions), Chrome will display an error message.
Use the Extension

After successful installation, you can start using the extension right away.
If it has an icon, click it from the toolbar to interact with it.
Troubleshooting (if needed)

If you see an error after loading the extension, go back to the chrome://extensions page, and click Details under your extension.
Check the error messages or logs to identify and fix issues like missing permissions or invalid file paths.
